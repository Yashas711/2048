# 2048 Game
A simple implementation of the popular puzzle game 2048 using Python and the Tkinter library.

## Game Description
The game is played on a 4x4 grid, with numbered tiles that can be combined to create a tile with the value of 2048. The game ends when a tile with the value of 2048 is created or when there are no more moves left.

## Gameplay
- Use the arrow keys to move the tiles up, down, left, or right.
- When two tiles with the same value collide, they merge into a single tile with the value of the sum of the two tiles.
- A new tile with a value of 2 or 4 is added to the grid after each move.
- The game ends when a tile with the value of 2048 is created or when there are no more moves left.
